Use sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently. 
Flyweight is all about memory and sharing and it is achieved by segregating object properties into two types intrinsic and extrinsic


  Need to create large number of objects of similar nature 
  Because of the large number when memory cost is a constraint
  When most of the object attributes can be made external and shared
